# Ecommerce-supply-chain-analysis
This project aims to perform comprehensive supply chain analysis for a company using Python.
As a data analyst, I've developed a set of tools and scripts to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize supply chain data, providing valuable insights into the company's logistics and procurement processes.
To analyze a company's supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain like data sourcing,manufacturing,transportation,sales and customer demographic.
#Key Features:
Data Collection: Utilize Python to collect data from various sources, including APIs, databases, and external datasets, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Employ data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the integrity of the dataset.
Analysis and Modeling: Leverage statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns, trends, and potential areas for optimization within the supply chain.
Visualization: Create interactive visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate key findings and trends effectively.
#Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Collection: Requests, Pandas
Database Integration: SQLite, SQLAlchemy
Jupyter Notebooks: Utilized for exploratory data analysis and documentation.
